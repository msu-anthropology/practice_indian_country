    <h3>Introduction</h3>
		<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		      <p>The Klamath river is the second largest river in California, running over 257 miles across Oregon and Northern California and emptying into the Pacific Ocean. This river has supplemented the lifestyles of Indigenous peoples for 7,000 years and has become a sacred aspect to the tribes along the Klamath for generations. However, in recent decades a series of government funded hydropower dams have been constructed along the Klamath river (A 2017). These dams produce minimal power and devastating consequences on the rivers habitat by cutting off miles of Klamath’s upper drainage. The pollution, irrigation and new dam construction along the Klamath River has caused a devastation to the river’s marine life for decades. Previously, supporting one third of the salmon run on the west coast, the river now runs only a fraction of the life it used to. After a major fish kill in 2002, push for broader water management along the Klamath has been the focus of the tribes living along its waters. The result came to be the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement which is set to remove the dams along the Klamath starting in 2020 (A 2017). This site takes an in depth look into the exact causes and consequences of the fish kills along the Klamath River as well as looking at how the long-standing Yurok tribe has federally combated the issue today.</p>

    <h3>History of the Klamath River</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
          <p>Fishing marine resources along the Klamath river is an important aspect in the lifeways of the tribes along the Klamath including the <a href="http://www.yuroktribe.org/">The Yurok</a>, <a href="http://klamathtribes.org/">Klamath</a>, <a href="https://www.hoopa-nsn.gov/">Hoopa</a>, <a href="http://www.karuk.us/">Karuk<a/> and <a href="http://www.shastaindiannation.org/">Shasta</a> tribes. (Click on a tribes name for a link to their webpages and to learn more information). The Klamath river has long been a hot spot for commercial use and Indigenous communities due to its vast size and convenient location. Since settlers have gained control of the Klamath river, several modifications and constructions have impacted the area. A series of Dams have been constructed along the Klamath with the first beginning in 1918. This dam construction project is referred to as The Hydroelectric Power Project. Below is a relatively condensed timeline of construction and management along the Klamath river condenensed from Klamath Basin Chronolgy assement. (A 2017).</p>
    <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
            <ul>
              <li>1918: Copco 1The first dam on the Klamath river becomes operational. salmon runs end in the Upper Klamath Basin.</li>
              <li>1921: Link River Dam completed. control of water releases from Upper Klamath Lake is obtained.</li>
              <li>1925: Copco 2 Dam completed and operating.</li>
              <li>1928: Dingell Dam constructed on the Shasta River. Spawning habitat to the largest Klamath Basin salmon run is no longer accessible.</li>
              <li>1933: Tribal gill-net fishing is banned.</li>
              <li>1954: Federal government liquidates Klamath tribes’ reservation lands.</li>
              <li>1958: Big Bend Dam completed.</li>

              <li>1976: Oregon Water Resources Department begins Klamath Basin water rights adjudication process.</li>
              <li>1986: Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration Act passes in Congress.</li>
              <li>1986: sucker fishery on Upper Klamath Lake is closed by Klamath tribes.</li>
              <li>1988: Lost River and short nose suckers listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act.</li>
              <li>1992: Severe decline in Klamath River salmon runs.</li>
              <li>1993: Klamath River tribal salmon fishing limit is set to half the total available harvest by federal law.</li>
              <li>2000: PacifiCorp begins federal relicensing process for the Klamath Hydroelectric Project dams.</li>
              <li>2002: 34,952 salmon die in the lower Klamath River in September.</li>
              <li>2013: Klamath region in drought. Water rights are passed in the Upper Klamath Basin for the first time. Irrigation to agricultural growers in the upper basin is cut off.</li>
              <li>2016: Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Commerce, PacifiCorp, and Oregon and California sign agreement to remove four dams on the Klamath River by 2020 following a process administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</li>
              <li>2020: Earliest year in which dam removal would begin under the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the timeline shows, even with restoration processes and lowered fishing number the devastation of the Klamath fish kills still took place. This evidence from the timeline shows how the operation of the dams constructed quickly impacted the Klamath river environment over one century. Currently, new progress has been made in restoring the damage done.</p>

    <h3>The Klamath River Fish Kills</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <h4>What Happened?</h4>
      <figure style="float: right; width: 30%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
        <img src="img/fishkillcloseup.jpg" width="100%" />
         <figcaption>Image 3: Picture taken by Yurok Tribe during the aftermath of the fish kills in mid-September</figcaption>
     </figure>
            <p>On September 19, 2002 a report of dead fish on the Klamath river lead to full scale investigation by Yurok tribal fisheries program, Hoopa valley tribe, us fish and wildlife services and California department of fish and game. It was reported that 34,925 fish were killed in total with 87% of those fish being Chinook Salmon according to the USFWS (Belchik 2004). The fish kills were concentrated to the lower 30 miles of the Klamath river from the rivers mouth at Requa to coon creek. This area is mainly confined within the Yurok Indian reservation, making this tribe the most affected by the epidemic. It was also concluded that no dead fish were found above the Trinity River No such fish kills have ever been reported in history along the Klamath. This marks the fish kills as an event outside of any biological process with its cause from a human factor (Belchik 2004).</P>
            <p>According to a report done by the Yurok tribal fisheries program in 2004, The causative factor of the fish kills in 2002 was due to a low water flow in the river leading to the festering of deadly parasites (Belchik 2004). Two fish parasites, ich and columnaris, were found to be the leading cause of the fish kills. Both Ich and columnaris are fatal diseases for fish that rapidly repopulate once one fish has been infected. Both parasites thrive in low water flow. Low flow creates higher temperatures and more densely populated fish. The temperature reported before the fish kills in the river was exceptionally high (Belchik).</p>
            <p>While it is known how the fish died, the question raises as to what happened to the Klamath’s natural river flow to cause such low flows that lead to this epidemic?</p>
            <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
      <h4>The Cause</h4>
            <p>It is known that dams disrupt river flows, degrade water quality, block the movement of a river’s vital nutrients and sediment and can destroy the habitat of fish and wildlife. Dams have an enormous effect on it surrounding environment an must be monitored extremely closely. A small change in operation could have devastating consequences on the dams surrounding environments and communities (Dixon 2012).</p>

         </figure>
         <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
            <p>From the Yurok analysis, it was shown that the Iron Gate Dam, constructed in 1962, was the main catalyst in the fish kills of 2002. The low flows from Iron Gate occured after Secretary of the INterior, Gale Norton, gave the okay to divert the dams water ways for irrigation for hurtin framers in an ongoing drought. The Iron Gate dam controls the 89% of the flow where the fish kill occurred in the lower Klamath River (Belchik 2004).  The flow being pushed from Iron Gate Dam was also the only factor controllable by humans and the low flow the dam produced created the perfect environment for deadly parasites to fester. </p>

         </figure>
         <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
            <p>“Had the flow from Iron Gate Dam in August and September been at or above approximately 1000 cfs, as they were in all other years of above average escapements, it is likely that the fish kill would not have occurred” (Belchik 2004)</p>
            <p>Iron Gates Dam flow rate had been at its lowest in 2002 with only 757 cfs. The low flow rate from the Iron gate dam not only caused higher temperatures and poor water quality to fast track infectious fish diseases but it also gave the fish a lack of migration cues for fish. This led to a heavy concentration of fish in the lower Klamath river with an above average fish total of 160,000 in the lower Klamath when 140,000 was expected. In this case there were more fish running into a lower flowing river. The low flow of only 757cfs with an unexpectedly high fish count in the area due to the low flow by Iron Gate Dam, created the perfect conditions for Ich and Columnaris. It was reported that if the cfs had been at 1300 or above, as it should have been, it would have relieved fish crowding by 25%, therefore potentially decreasing the scale of the fish epidemic since it is known that flow can ameliorate infections. Iron Gate Dam was reported to immediately raise its cfs flow from 757 to 1300 directly after the fish kill epidemic.</p>

     <h3>The Importance of The Klamath River for The Yurok People</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p></p>The Yurok people are referred to as the “Downriver People”. In their native Klamath tongue, they call themselves “Pue-lik-lo’” which translates to “Down River Indian” (Yurok Tribe 2006). The very heart of their name is centered around the river that the Yurok have called a home for generations. The Klamath river is the lifeline of the Yurok people. The river provides the majority of the tribe’s food supply, including chinook salmon, as well as their means of living. On the Yurok website, they state that the Yurok people have always been known as great fisherman. Fishing is the main activity to provide subsistence and also financial stability. The Yurok Tribe relies heavily in traditional means of fishing such as gill netting which has become a vital activity of Yurok culture and tradition (Yurok Tribe 2006). The Yurok people rely so heavily on the Klamath river for their basic means of survival that the flowing river has become the center for their culture and religious ceremonies (Yurok Tribe 2006). The Yurok people use the rivers natural growing plants along its banks for medicine and are extremely skilled canoers taking part in a large fishing festival each year along the Klamath. The Klamath River has deeper roots than just a means to an end for the Yurok Tribe (Yurok Tribe 2006). As stated on the tribe’s webpage “Our way was never to over harvest and to always ensure sustainability of our food supply for future generations.” The aftermath of the Klamath fish kills was not only devastating to the Yurok’s food and economy but also their culture and way of life.

     <h3>Current Progress of Issue</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>While the Klamath Fish Kills of 2002 still dominate most of the arguments today, severe droughts and environmental affects of the Hydro Project dams are still substantially affecting the area. Current salmon populations continue to decrease with fish populations at 46% of the normal rate. With less fish for the tribes due to low flow and less water for farmers due to the drought, Scott white executive director of the Klamath water user’s association calls the current satiation “an operational nightmare” (Smith 2018)</p>
      <figure style="float: left; width: 35%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

          <figcaption>Image 8: Yurok memeber protesting for water managment along the Klamath River. Photo source: The New Food Economy by Patrick McCully()</figcaption>
     </figure>
      <p>The fish kills and environmental effects of the dams have occurred mainly within the confines of the Yurok tribe reservation. After being impacted the hardest from the epidemic, the Yurok tribe has been the forefront in battling the issue (Smith 2020). The Yurok Tribe has been organizing protest after protest for the removal of the ever destructive Hydro Power dams along the Klamath as well as more effective water managment for future sustainability of the river (Chaffin et al. 2016).</p>

   </figure>
      <p>After witnessing the 2002 fish kills first hand and being a victim of the current damage to the Klamath ecosystem, graduate student and Yurok tribal member Amy Cordalis, became Yuroks first ever tribal general counsel. Amy Coralis’ efforts put Yurok into intense legal battles with the supreme court over the Klamath River and water management for the area(Smith 2018). With Cordilas' help recently a district court ruled salmon on Klamath as a priority under law diverting water back into the river once infection rates became over the legal limit (Smith 2018). After low salmon numbers and commercial fishing was closed in 2006, PacifiCorp, the hydropower operator, was looking toward many environmental law suits after it was evident the damage that was done to the Klamath was from the dams. Working with Yurok tribe and the government the Klamath River Renewal Corporation was created. This group aggreged upon the Klamath Basin restoration act which is set to remove four of the eight major dams along the Klamath starting with the first removal in 2020 (Smith 2018). This will be the largest dam removal in United States history. With two major wins for the Yurok tribe, Cordilas is still pushing for better water management and use of the river today to implement better sustainability for future generations. (Smith 2018).</p>

     <h3>The Fight for Water</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>The original reason for lowering the river flow of the Klamath was in part due to the drought of the area affecting local farmers. The farmers pushed the government for more irrigation from the river, diverting its water ways from the ecosystem. While the effects of this problem are being resolved, farmers along the Klamath are hurting more than ever with less water being diverted their way once the Dams are decommissioned in 2020 and an ever-growing drought to the area.</p>
      <p>While the Klamath basin restoration act is a huge win for the Yurok Tribe, it is in turn jeopardizing the lives of others in the area by diverting water ways back into the river. In response to this issue the federal and state governments of California and Oregon have signed a new agreement called the Klamath Power and Facilities Agreement. This will help farmers and ranchers in the area financially once the source of their irrigation will be cut off once the dams are deconditioned (Kershaw 2016).</p>
      <p>While this may seem like a win for both sides, the farmers are losing their lifeways while the damage done to the Klamath is still present. Fish number have been steadily decling and from recent reviews, it seems as though there may not be enough salmon even after the decommisionsing of the dams to support the tribe (Danovich 2018). The question arises, is there a way for both sides to sustain their lifeways and keep the Klamath a natural flowing ecosystem?</p>
