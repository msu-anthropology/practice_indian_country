         <h3> History of Violence Against Indigenous Women </h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

        <p> Three decades of missing and murdered Indigenous women amounts to a “Canadian genocide.” Thousands of Indigenous women
           have been lost to the Canadian genocide to date. The “persistent and deliberate human and Indigenous rights violations
           and abuses are the root cause behind Canada’s staggering rates of violence.” The inquiry concluded that Canada has committed a
           genocide against the Indigenous peoples within its colonial borders, and is continuing to maintain systems and structures that result in Indigenous women and
           girls and Two-Spirit people experiencing a disproportionate amount of violence. The Indigenous people have long understood — that the violence
           they experience is a product of settler colonialism. The continuation of the Canadian settler state requires the destabilization of Indigenous communities —
           and a part of this stabilization has involved rampant gender-based violence to uphold the legitimacy of the settler state’s rule over land and water.
           While settler colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples of all genders, it makes women, girls and Two-Spirit people especially vulnerable to violence. </p>

         <p>  Over the past thirty years, there have been 164 missing and 1017 murdered Indigenous women and girls. Indigenous women are “the most victimized group in Canadian society” (Gilchrest).
           Representing approximately ten percent of all female homicides in Canada, Indigenous women make up only four percent of the Canadian female population (NWAC). Indigenous women are also three times more likely to be killed by a stranger than
           non-Indigenous women (NWAC). Further, homicide cases involving Indigenous women are less likely to lead to charges (53 percent) compared to non-Indigenous women (84 percent)(NWAC). Non-Indigenous Canadians’ negative perceptions and lack of support for MMIWG is,
            in part, a result of media’s framing, as MMIWG are consistently both underrepresented and misrepresented in the media.</p>
         <hr>
           <h3> The Media's Attention </h3>
         <hr>
           <p> We all know the media focus's on what they want, or what they find most important. Well, According to a new report from the Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI), more than 500 indigenous women and girls have gone missing
             or have been murdered across 71 cities with almost no media coverage. The majority of the urban indigenous females ended up as murder victims. This Lack of media could be bringing more danger to missing and murdered women in Winnepg, Canada. </p>

           <p> The lack of awareness they bring to these women who go missing, compared to other races and genders needs to be looked at. It could be possible that less violence towards these indigenous women and girls could be taking place along
            with more intentional investigations, which could lead to more bodies being found and more support from outside sources. If media were to do its job, without discrimination and bring awarness to the issue that is so loud but, but made to
            be quiet. We decided to give a couple examples below, of attention that is being made to fix this "commonplace" issue and bring awareness. </p>

           <h4> The REDress Project </h4>
           <img src="img/hauntingdresses.jpg" width="50%">
           <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The REDress Project, an outdoor art installation by artist Jaime Black at Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C."> The Red Dresses </a></figcaption>
</figure>


             <p> The Red Dress  project is "about bringing awareness to those women who have gone missing, who have been murdered, who we're still searching for, to bring
               awareness to our communities, to bring awareness also to our families and the continued struggle and grief that they are experiencing and wanting to give
               acknowledgement in a respectful way and tell our stories." Jamie Black states that her work, "is informed by and emerges from the places where the social, cultural, political and personal intersect.
               I use my work as a tool for exploring, connecting and questioning our current and historical socio-political framework and the ways in which we behave within that framework. I aim to provoke and incite
               dialogue around these issues by making work that provides viewers with the opportunity to approach them from a different perspective. </p>

             <p>  Jamies REDress project focuses around the issue of missing or murdered Aboriginal women across Canada. It is an installation art project based on an aesthetic response to this critical national issue. The project seeks to collect 600 red dresses by
               community donation that will later be installed in public spaces throughout Winnipeg and across Canada as a visual reminder of the staggering number of women who are no longer with us. Through the installation artist Jamie Black
               hopes to draw attention to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Aboriginal women and to evoke a presence through the marking of absence. </p>

           <h4> Drag The Red </h4>
           <img src="img/redriverwomen.jpg" width="50%">
           <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The Red River has become a known place in Winnipeg to dump the remains of Aboriginal women. It is also next to the monument representing the missing and murdered Aboriginal women in Winnipeg.  "> Search the River</a></figcaption>
</figure>


             <p> Drag the Red is a nonprofit organization based out of Winnipeg, Ontario with hopes of helping identify missing indigenous women in the Red River. This organization has existed since 2014,
                following the death of Tina Fontaine, a 15 year old indigenous woman who was found at the bottom of the river. This led to a outcry from the tribal members, leading to the creation of Drag the Red.
                Drag the Red is composed of multiple first nations tribal members willing to dedicate hardwork and effort to find justice for the murdered and missing indigenous women of Winnipeg. This group has
                received nationwide media coverage, yet not as much as other campaigns, such as the REDress project.
             <p>The largest media feature the Drag the Red campaign has had so far has been a short Vice Documentary, airing in 2015 and as of April 13th 2020 has close to 372,000 views. This media representation
               is composed of 22 minutes of interviews and background on the missing and murdered indigenous women that these search teams are motivated by, as well as shedding light on the lack of representation
               and funding these types of organizations have. While this documentary was helpful for the organization and actually funding a valuable source of fixing a large component of the issue surrounding
               the Canadian Genocide, this only lasted for a short time period. Other media formats, such as local newspapers have shed light on this issue, yet large amounts of funding are still being searched
               for as they are not supported by the Winnipeg police department for their dragging of the river bed, as well as needing the equipment (boats and hooks) for this operation.
               <p> With Relation to police envolement, Staff Sgt. Rob Riffel has stated that he belives that dragging the river would be a "a bad allocation of our resources" and support the campaign "morally but without resources", as heard in
                 the Vice Documentary (Vice, 2015). These types of responses from police forces, continue to show the lack of work put in by the authorities to come to some resolution on these horrible issues. Another statement from the Winnipeg police
                 department described the lack of searching of the Red River, their explanation included many components of safety concerns related to the black water and also thought that diving in this river would be not worth the search, due to the likelihood
                 of finding a body. This type of mindset has continued in many different indigenous issues today, where the importance of the issue seems small, even if it could be extremely vital to the people who lost their loved ones. When asked about police involvement,
                 the leading organizors of Drag the Red pointed out how long it would take police to investigate if they found any traces of human remains and the lack of care put into these investigations.

   <h4> Political Action </h4>

   <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Not Invisible Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill placed in Congress to “increase intergovernmental coordination to identify and combat violent crime within Indian lands and of Indians” (Salam 2019)"> Stolen Sisters</a></figcaption>
</figure>


    <p>With the increase of media attention on the murder and missing indigenous women around both the United States and Canada, it has spurred the conversation of what the true solution is for this issue. Sadly, at the moment the amount of
      contributing factors makes a resolution to these horrible instances seem grim. Systematically, the patterns of aggression towards indigenous women and the way these acts have been perceived by the Federal government, as well as the
      steps to stop these crimes being ignored by the public, have created a perfect storm for violence. The media attention on these crimes, for example the death of 16 year old Selena Not Afraid has created a call to action needed
      to create political change (Martin 2019).Her death also shed light on how these missing and murdered women simply become a headline, yet little is done to create change. Their name is heard for around a week, then its importance and recognition is passed to the side.
    <p>An extremely important article showing the startling truth of this issue was found in The New York times, highlighting the death of Selena Not Afraid. In 2019, a short article was published showed the powerful and sad statistics surrounding the amount of trafficking and murdered and missing indigenous women, primarily in the United States, as well as described the Not Invisible Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill placed in Congress to “increase intergovernmental coordination to identify and combat violent crime within Indian lands and of Indians” (Salam 2019). While this act is still in the House right now, and has passed the senate, it is important to shed light on this issue on one of the most popular and well known American newspapers. This type of publicity may not be the best way to solve this issue, but it educates and informs hundreds of thousands on tragic circumstances that may spark an urgency to act. From reaching out to senators to donating to causes such as Drag the Red, the need for information surrounding these issues to be portrayed in the media must be immediate.

               <hr>
               <p> The final report from the national inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contains 231 calls for justice. Here’s how regular citizens can effect change. Many of the calls to justice are
                 directed toward governments, but some are directed at Canadians themselves. Here are five of those calls — and ways in which, according to the report, regular citizens can put them into action.

                 <p> “Denounce and speak out against violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people”
                   <p> “Decolonize by learning the true history of Canada and Indigenous history in your local area”
                 <p> “Develop knowledge and read the final report”
                   <p> “Using what you have learned and some of the resources suggested, become a strong ally”
                 <p> “Help hold all governments accountable to act on the calls for justice”
