		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Inupiat (Eskimos) of Utqiaġvik, AK are part of a large group of Arctic Natives whose cultures span over multiple continents. Living in an area of the world that most wouldn’t even consider, with temperatures below freezing almost year-round, these individuals have learned to adapt to the environment and make the most out of their traditional lifestyles. With an overall population of around 20,700 individuals (1), those not working for one of the numerous oil companies make a living by: reindeer herding, hunting, fishing, and whaling. Though not oblivious to modern ways of doing things, these individuals still like to use the traditional ways of their ancestors in activities of daily living. However, there is a major issue plaguing Arctic Native communities and those of their Native American cousins. Statistically, these individuals have higher rates of mental illness than other cultures within in the United States. Specifically, one factor that studies have shown could be affecting Arctic Natives is Seasonal Affective Disorder.</p>

		<h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a disorder that can affect anyone who experiences mood, energy level, libido, etc. changes based on the weather. The Mayo Clinic characterizes this as “a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons — SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year.” (2). For most people the effects of SAD manifest during the fall and winter months due to gloomier weather with less sunlight. However, for some the effects also take place during the spring and summer months with excess sun light.<br>

	<img src="images/sad-statistics.jpg" width="100%" />
	<figcaption>Image 2 - "SAD Statistics."</figcaption>
</figure>
		 <br>Signs and Symptoms for each are below:<br>
		 <br><strong>Fall and Winter SAD aka "Winter Depression"</strong><br>
		 <br>Oversleeping
		 <br>Increased Appetite (Particularly for Carbohydrates)
		 <br>Weight Gain
		 <br>Memory Loss
		 <br>Inability to make decisions
		 <br>Problems concentrating
		 <br>Tiredness or Lethargy
		 <br>Low self-esteem (feeling of worthlessness or guilt)
		 <br>Suicidal thoughts</br>
		 <br><strong>Spring and Summer SAD aka "Summer Depression"</strong><br>
		 <br>Trouble Sleeping (Insomnia)
		 <br>Poor Appetite
		 <br>Weight Loss
		 <br>Agitation or Anxiety (2)
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <br>Why is this such a risk for Inupiat Eskimos and other Arctic Natives? Let us take a closer look at the town of Utqiaġvik, AK.</p>
		 <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=""><!--this is the required <a href> tag for inline reference popups--></a>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
		 <h3>Utqiaġvik, Alaska</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">The town of Utqiaġvik, commonly called Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost city that is part of the United States. With a population of around 4,400 people and 60.5% claiming Alaska Native (AN) or American Indian (AI) ancestry, it’s also one of the largest communities of Inupiat Eskimos in the world. Due to the arctic geographical location, with a latitude of 71 degrees, these individuals experience 7-10 weeks of virtually no sunlight (polar night) (3) and roughly 10 weeks of no darkness (midnight sun) each year. It’s also completely overcast for more than 50% of the year. These are prime conditions for the manifestation of SAD and its associated symptoms.</pr>
		 <br>
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">These weather extremes can cause severe changes in individuals sleep cycle, melatonin, and serotonin levels. For many, this results in observable changes in mood and activities of daily living. If left unchecked, SAD can lead to severe depression, substance abuse, and even suicide. Its effects can create even worse issues for individuals already diagnosed with one of the listed associated symptoms. With the current mental health statistics of Arctic Natives, it poses a huge concern.  A study of 111 randomly selected members of an arctic community, similar to those of the Inupiat, showed some pretty startling results. They found, “One in five (22.6%) of the community sample was found to be depressed. Of these, seven (6.3%) had seasonal affective disorder (SAD), with fall onset occurring in six of these (5.4%). Subsyndromal SAD (SSAD) occurred in 11.7%, while any effect of the seasons (seasonality) occurred in 39.6%.” (4). With that said, it’s easy to see how weather can play a huge part in the mental health of Arctic communities. </p>
		 <br>
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Sadly, some individuals suffering the effects result to drugs and alcohol in the hopes it will help them feel better. These coping mechanisms might make them feel better temporarily but usually end up having even more adverse effects. One study found that lifetime prevalence rates of alcohol dependence or abuse within selected AN/AI communities range from 27 to 51 percent (5&6). Also, a 2008 report showed AN/AI suicide rate of 13.1% vs the national average of 3.7% for those over the age of 18 (7). There are many underlying factors that can attributed to these high statistics but it’s hard for one to say SAD can’t be one of them in Arctic Native communities.</p>

		 <h3>SAD Treatments</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		  <figure style="float: left; width: 35%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
	<img src="images/sad-treatments.png" width="100%" />
	<figcaption>Image 3 - "SAD Treatments."</figcaption>
</figure>
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">There are a couple options that most can seek out to help treat SAD symptoms. The more common and westernized being light therapy, medications, and psychotherapy. Details for each are below:</pr>
		<br>
		<p>Light therapy can come in many forms but the main being in the form of a battery powered box filled with fluorescent lights. It produces anywhere between 5K-10K lux of light and is usually placed 2-3 feet away, facing the individual. Session times can vary but the average is said to be either ½ hour at 10K lux or one hour at 5K lux.(8)</p>
		<br>
		<p>Medication treatment is the same for those who experience depression. However, this treatment is usually something that will be taken year-round. To mitigate any negative effects from medication withdrawal, it is safer to keep the individual on the medication and just alter dosage as necessary.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Psychotherapy for SAD is similar to that for PTSD patients. This consists of counseling sessions to identify the negative thoughts or behaviors and find a healthy coping mechanism. The key here is to get the individual out of their comfort zone in order to live a more fulfilling life.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 40px">Due to the remote location and climate where the Inupiat Eskimos live, it’s not always easy to get to those westernized treatments. Anyone who lives just outside the city needs to be airlifted to the Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital for care since there are no roads leading in or out of Barrow. Due to similar difficulties, roughly 34-49% of Alaska Natives will seek their traditional healers to “focus on balancing mind, body and spirit within the community context” (9) before trying a westernized approach. All of which have been shown to be successful.</p>

		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">SAD and its associated symptoms are clearly affecting Arctic Natives today. Especially with the harsh climate and long periods of darkness and light that the Inupiat Eskimos endure through the year. The key to helping combat the high mental illness statistics is to get help when symptoms are recognized. There are SAD treatments options available. Since both westernized and traditional treatment methods have been found to be beneficial, it’s up to the person to make the call based on availability to them and their personal preference. By recognizing and seeking help, they can start to reduce AN/AI mental illness statistics and start promoting better mental health within their communities.</p>
