		<p>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls want to introduce Native Women's Association of Canada, also known as NWAC. This organization is a foundation that strives to "enhance, promote, and foster the social, economic, cultural and political well-being of First Nations and Metis and Canadian societies". This foundation is a non-profit organization since 1974. NWAC has a violence and prevention focus around violence against Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse. Here, we wanted to focus on awareness and prevention of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse. The reason for this focus is because there is an increasing amount of Indigenous women coming up missing and murdered. This webpage will reside in details of how the NWAC has brought to light awareness and prevention for this rising issue within the Canadian community. The end goal is to connect to the anthropological theory that one's experience can bring forth the face of understanding and peace to this topic.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The history of missing and murdered indigenous women goes back to the 1970's and 80's. When it comes to 1980-2012, Indigenous women represent
    16% of female homicides in Canada. In 1997 to 2000, Aboriginal females were seven times more likely to fall victim to homicide than other females.
    These numbers show that there was a lot of knowledge about this topic, but less awareness to help prevention. The prevention rate was low. In the
    United States, Native American women are more likely to experience violence than other demographics according to Wiki. So much time has passed and
    in 2013 there was a Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorized. We learn here that NWAC database reported in 2010 from 1960's there were 582
    missing and murdered. The reason for this history is to give insight on how this topic has been around, but not focused over the years.
    <br>
    <h3>Significance</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This page wants to give you a look on violence and its significance. As like Australian Aboriginal people, it is obvious that the Canadian community may also feel invisible to this topic. There is a lot of things that go unnoticed or unfocused when it comes to violence against women before us, or even now. The importance here is to not leave victims to have to tell their own story and to become their own self-appointed spokesperson. The goal is to be a voice for the Canadian community, and to help raise awareness on something sensitive. According to the NWAC, the United Nations defines violence against women as a "gender-based violence that can result in physical, sexual or psychoological harm or suffering". The bigger picture is understanding that women of the Canadian community will never feel invisible, so long as they have others backing them to help spread awareness and prevention tactics to the unknowing crowd. When we think of unknown, we can look at millennials today, and just modern-day society as the unknown audience. This topic is not being taught in history classes in high schools. This is a topic that is now being introduced in the college world, only if you take an Indian history course. Violence is to be understood as something that can become a long-term issue one has to live with, because during a violent experience one person experiences something traumatic in their life. This page is to help us connect with women in an earlier time through awareness and prevention.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of the MMIWG & Violence Prevention Policy</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Native Women's Association of Canada has been working diligently towards resolving the senseless acts of violence affecting women, girls, and gender-diverse within Indigenous communities. The main purpose of their work is to provide healing and support services with long-term funding; these services are available for the community and family of these missing and murdered women, girls, and gender-diverse. By completing this, the NWAC hopes to create a community based around building strength and resilience ("Vision Statement"), as well as empower the indigenous community. They have created at least four educational and awareness based 'toolkits' for indigenous peoples to utilize. The 'toolkits' discussed below are: Honouring Indigenous Women, You Are Not Alone, Sisters in Spirit, and the Faceless Doll Project.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Honouring Indigenous Women</h4>
    <p>Indigenous communities, specifically the traditional roles individuals take on, were deeply affected by colonizers. With the Honouring Indigenous Women toolkit, the NWAC is attempting to give Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse the means to reclaim their heritage, as well as reinstate honor, empowerment, and respect to Native American culture and community. Furthermore, the NWAC hope to provide insight into a better understanding of the roles their ancestors took on. By doing so, they are able to give Indigenous youth a safe platform, where they can strengthen their understanding of traditional Indigenous values and heritage. Their focus for Indigenous youth resides in "traditional roles on women, defining respect and honor, valuing one's self, mindfulness, sustainability in culture, 2SLGBTQQIA, MMIWG and more" ("Honouring Indigenous Women"). This prepares these young children to think critically about future issues that may arise in Indigenous communities, and any personal adversities they may face. It brings them closer to their community and ancestry, as well.</p>
    <h4>You Are Not Alone</h4>
    <p>Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse are frequently confronted with the harsh reality of a settler colonial society. Years of discrimination, sexism, and racism have led to higher violence rates towards Indigenous women, than non-Indigenous women; the violence encountered commonly takes place within Indigenous families and communities. Indigenous women who are trapped in an abusive relationship will often lack the necessary resources to escape. The NWAC is providing victims of domestic violence with a safely planning toolkit to address their personal situation, as well as various educational resources (such as background information on how colonization has affected native communities, topics relating to domestic violence, support systems available within their community, and strategies for leaving an abuser.) Their goal is to support these women, and help them to realize they have the ability to change their environment for the better. The You Are Not Alone toolkit is helping to slowly eliminate the level of violence found in indigenous communities; it creates a healthy, safe, and happy environment for future generations to thrive.</p>
    <h4>Sisters in Spirit</h4>

      <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 3. Sisters in Spirit Logo.">Image 3. SIS</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Sisters in Spirit was originally created as a research and awareness initiative, which discussed rates of violence towards Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse. Now, the project has partnered with the NWAC and evolved into a tracking and investigation program. They research the causes of these violent attacks, and document the livelihood and memory of the missing and murdered women. In addition to this project, they host a yearly vigil on October 4th; this event is to honor the memory of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse.</p>
    <p>This policy has led to numerous other resources that are raising awareness within Indigenous communities (one of which is the NWAC's Faceless Doll Project). Each of these projects aims to showcase awareness, prevention, healing, and eventually help stop the ongoing problem of marginalization that plagues Indigenous communities.</p>
    <h4>NWAC's Faceless Doll Project</h4>

    </figure>
    <p>In order to honor the more than 600 cases of unknown missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse, the NWAC and Gloria Larocque would work together to create the Faceless Doll Project. They launched the project in 2013, and it is now a traveling exhibit.
    Hundreds of inspired families, community members, and allies contact the NWAC to ask them to continue with this project, and their faceless dolls. This initiative has proven to inspire Indigenous peoples of all ages, while simultaneously working as a tribute to the countless missing and murdered women.</p>

    <h3> Anthropological Perspective</h3>
    <p>One interesting take on this issue of missing and murdered women, is that a more inclusive approach needs to be taken. Anthropologists Hansen and Dim, of University of Saskatchewan, bring up that research shows Indigenous males are more likely to be murdered in Canada. Regardless to statistics, there are a staggering number of men and boys coming up missing and murdered that are being ignored. Galloway, 2017b, states men would only be included "to understanding if their circumstances contribute to the vulnerability of Indigenous women and girls". Their article aims to include men and boys in the inquiry of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Furthermore, they mention the divide that is occuring from this seperation. It makes it harder for Indigenous communities to work together, and denies men and boys education surrounding the topic of awareness and prevention in terms of missing and murdered Indigenous peoples.</p>
