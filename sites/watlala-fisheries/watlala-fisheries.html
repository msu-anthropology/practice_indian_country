      <h1>The Destruction of Watlala Fisheries</h1>
      <h3>Cascade Locks, Oregon</h3>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <br>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>It is no secret that the United States of America is a nation that was built in part on the exploitation of Native Americans, who have called the land home for millennia. In the Northwest region of the US, along the Colombia River, this fact is clearly illustrated. The US government has treated the tribes of this area with complete disregard for their humanity, including the Watlala band that lived along the river, following the migrating salmon run every year. In the past, the US government signed treaties designating fishing rights for Native Americans living in the area—sadly many of these promises remain unfulfilled to this day. US settlers, and later the federal government, forced the Watlala and other tribes off the land in several instances in order to develop the region for their own economic benefit. They made homelands unlivable, destroyed sacred sites and sources of food, which has put many species of salmon at risk or into extinction. While construction projects such as dams and highways often showed concern for white Americans living in the affected areas, the Watlala and other tribes in the area were not shown the same treatment. As a result, much of the prosperity of the surrounding region in Oregon and Washington is built on the suffering and deprivation of the Native American tribes who had been and remain the guardians of the Colombia River.</p>

		 <h3>History</h3>
		 <br>
		 <p>The Watlala band are a Native American tribe whose homelands stretched across the Colombia River, around what is today called the Cascade Locks (oregonencyclopedia.org). Though this is considered their original home, the Watlala were a part of four tribes who migrated along the river, following the salmon throughout the seasons and trading amongst each other. Their homelands spanned hundreds of thousands of square miles when Lewis and Clark first journeyed to their lands (ON LIVE). With the westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century, many of the people of these tribes were forced off their lands or killed. In 1855, the US government signed the Willamette Valley Treaty, which ceded much of the tribes’ lands to the US government in exchange for the right to “all usual and accustomed fishing places…in common with citizens.” (critfc.org) The tribes were confined to a fraction of their original lands. Meanwhile, the US has failed time and again to respect this treaty.</p>

		 <h3>Construction and Destruction</h3>
		 <br>
		 <p>In the 1930s, the US government under Franklin D. Roosevelt began the Bonneville Dam project, the first of several dam projects that saw the construction of dams to harness the hydroelectric power of the Colombia River. These dams came at a very high price for the Watlala and their fellow tribes that had safeguarded and lived off of the river for centuries. The Bonneville dam project, while producing immense amounts of power for the US, impeded salmon migration of 2800 miles of the fish’s habitat (critfc.org). In 1957, the US government opened the Dalles Dam, which further impeded the migration and harvesting of salmon in the river. It is estimated that the tribes harvested somewhere around 2.5 million pounds of fish annually (oregonlive.com). One town that was central to this harvest, Celilo, underwent a complete transformation, and with much of the area being submerged with the diversion of the river, this harvest was made unviable. These two dams, along with the John Day dam, provide around 40% of Oregon’s electricity (oregonlive.com), but the Watlala and other tribes in the area saw one of the most important aspects of their identity and livelihood destroyed or irreparably damaged.</p>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Special Treatment and Sacrilege</h3>
		 <br>
		 <p>While the Watlala and other tribes have seen the Colombia River transformed at their expense, the US government treated white Americans in the area much differently. With the construction of the dams, many white settlers in the area also had to move out of the new path of the diverted river. However, the federal government allocated over $52 million dollars to moving thousands of citizens in the mostly white towns in the area. At the same time, the Army Corps of Engineers allocated only $210,000 to moving 44 tribal members (oregonlive.com). Needless to say, far more Native Americans were affected by the dams’ construction than that. Despite the great economic wealth that came from the dams, the federal government deemed Native lives to be worth less funding than white lives—250 times less in this instance. In addition to the construction of the dams, a recent highway expansion has resulted in the same trends for the Watlala and the other tribes living along the river. In 2008, the US highway 26 was widened. This highway, which runs through Mount Hood on the Colombia river, was expanded again at the expense of the original inhabitants of the area, though white settlers living along the river were given far more extensive care. The government’s bias and dehumanizing view of Native Americans is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that the plans to widen the highway ended with the destruction of a sacred site called The Place of Big Big Trees, which the Watlala and other tribes have held sacred since before the US was a colony. At the same time, the plans to widen the highway were altered in order to avoid encroaching on the property of a tattoo parlor and wetlands in the area (mintpressnews.com). While tribes in the area have argued that the road could have been widened on the other side of the road, it seems that the federal government was unwilling to pay heed to the concerns of those who have lived on the land for so long.</p>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Resistance and Action</h3>
		 <br>
		 <p>In response to decades of pillaging of ancestral homelands, 4 tribes in the area (which the Watlala are a part of) formed the Colombia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission in 1977 in order to try and protect the rights of their people to fish and live in the area which they have always called home (critfc.org). The Commission has fought to secure funds in order to secure housing and the means to protect and police their own communities in areas that are subject to poverty and lack of adequate infrastructure and protections. In 2010, the Commission secured the funds for law enforcement commissions for each of the 4 main tribes living in the area (critfc.org). While this has helped the tribes cut down on violence and vandalism and deal with some of the challenges of daily life, many challenges still remain. There is a critical lack of electricity, housing, and road and other infrastructure in the area due to years of reckless negligence on the part of the federal government. Still, the CRITFC has done quite a lot of good work, building lighting structures, boat ramps, and cleaning facilities in order to facilitate the harvest of the salmon that have long been their lifeblood. Still, the $6.3 million that were allocated for the tribes are not enough to ensure basic human rights such as housing. The funds are running low, despite the fact that the Army Corps of Engineers calculated the funds to last for 50 years (oregonlive.com). It is clear that more needs to be done to provide compensation and reparations for the long history of violence and gross mistreatment of the tribes.</p>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <br>
		 <p>The Colombia River has long been a provider to the people who have lived along its banks. For the Watlala and their fellow tribes, it was a sacred force that provided life, food, and water to the people for centuries. With the westward expansion of the United States of America, the river was morphed by American interests, which paid no heed to the people who had been living there for countless generations. Still, the Colombia River provided these settlers with life, giving them electricity and allowing the development of large towns and cities, though the American settlers have stolen and continue to steal that life from the tribes who act as its guardians. In a country that was founded on the exploitation of so many people, it is only a matter of time before the debt must be paid and all the previously exploited must be guaranteed the means to a human existence in peace and prosperity.</p>
