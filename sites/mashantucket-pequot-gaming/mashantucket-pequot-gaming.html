      <h3>Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation</h3>

         <h3>Introduction </h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p> Sovereignty is the right of a people to govern over themselves, a right that many nations across what is now considered North America have practiced unhindered for millennia. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation has called Connecticut home for thousands of years exercising this right. European arrival in the early 1600’s sought to undermine Indigenous self-government with subordination and eradication. Despite centuries of war, disease, and genocide, the Pequots have continued to persevere as a community and fight to take back their historic right to self government.  </p>

     <p> Sovereignty encompasses all parts of a nation and the lives of its people. It allows them to make decisions in their own interest without fear of of outside intrusion. While in the United States, Tribal-Federal relations are not an equal nation-to-nation relationship, Federal Recognition acknowledges the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation’s sovereignty and their ability to make decisions for themselves without State interference. With this power of self-determination, the nation has been able to open gaming facilities despite the protest of outside groups. They have the ability and authority to make decisions and exercise their sovereignty as they continue to operate gaming operations. </p>

     <h3>Fight for Sovereignty</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p> In the present, while Indigenous nations have never given up their sovereignty, it has systematically been desecrated. Since the end of the 19th century, the United States has made a point of not recognizing Indigenous sovereignty and no longer recognizing a full nation-to-nation relationship. While the federal government has recently created a process in 1978 to once again recognize Indigenous nations, it is important to note that Federal Recognition in not sovereignty (The State 59). Federal recognition is simply the federal government “recognizing” a tribe, not allowing them to exercise full sovereignty. Tribal nations are still held subordinate to the federal government.  </p>
     <p>In the 1970s, the Federal Government of the United States started proceedings for Federal Recognition of Indigenous Nations. However, the Pequot nation had never stopped being its own community. In the centuries before this, the Pequot community had remained against great attempts by the settler government. Having been granted a reservation in 1666 of 989 acres, the group whose numbers had been greatly reduced first by raging disease and then in the 1830’s the Pequot War, a genocidal conflict that ended with European victory and subjugation, watched as the land allotted to the tribe was reduced greatly over the years by illegal land sale (About). By 1856, only 213 acres remained and the on-reservation population decreased as members left to find employment. When the possibility of land reclamation arose in the 70’s, many members demanded to have the wrongs against their community addressed (About). They brought the landowners on the illegally sold land to court. A settlement was reached that would recover the land, but for this to be accessible, they had to have federal recognition and so in 1983 they were finally successful (About).

     <h3>Sovereignty and Gaming</h3>

<p>	Federal recognition allowed for something besides land reclamation, it made it possible for tribe to exercise rights as a sovereign nation. While tribes in the United States do not possess a nation-to-nation relationship with the United States, recognized tribes have autonomy, though subordinate to the Federal government.  </p>
<p>Tribal gaming, is an example of both self governance and government intervention. Three years after receiving Federal recognition, The Mashantucket Pequots started a bingo operation. In 1987, California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians reestablished that tribes have the right to operate gaming facilities despite pre-existing external state regulations (Lawlor 154). In 1988, the Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act (IGRA) was passed, creating a gaming structure for Indigenous operations that is stipulated by the American federal government. The IGRA was created in response to the concerns of states and Indigenous sovereignty. In many ways, it impedes on tribal sovereignty as it requires tribes to follow the desires of the state (Lawlor 154). Despites efforts and negative claims by the state, due to pre-existing gambling in the state, they could not legally reject the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation’s goal of opening a casino. Because of pre-existing gambling in Connecticut, they could not use a criminal prohibitory policy that would make a tribal gaming subject to criminal law. Instead, because of its civil policy, (where gaming was already allowed and operating in the state) they could not stop the tribe’s gaming or enforce the laws of the state on the reservation (Chen). However, to open a casino, a Class IIII operation, the tribe had to form a compact with the state a of Connecticut. The state, however, refused to even negotiate. The Mashantucket Pequot then brought the state to court, which ruled in favor of the tribe, forcing the state to begin negotiations (Chen). In accordance with the criteria laid out in IGRA, the State of Connecticut, which already permitted gambling when the nation sought to open their Class III gaming operation, made a compact with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. A minimum of 25% of the tribe’s monthly revenue from video facsimile is given to the state (Chen). The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation opened Foxwood Casino in 1992, resulting in economic development in the region, not only for the tribe, but the state in general (Chen). Today, the tribe is one of the leading employers in the state and also one of biggest tax payers (About).
</p>
<p>The right to self government has allowed the Pequot tribe to operate gaming facilities. Gaming is a right that the Mashantucket Pequot are allowed to operate under their sovereign status, and with it they have transformed their community. As of 2006, 224 out of the 561 federally recognized tribes were recorded as managing some form of gaming in their community (The State 148). Revenue from tribal gaming, however, has done more than appease the state government, it has benefitted the Mashantucket Pequot community. </p>

     <h3>The Effect of Gaming on the Community</h3>

     </figure>
<p>While casinos are often given a negative image, the operation of gaming facilities has benefitted the State of Connecticut, and more importantly, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. The casino and its subsequent revenue have allowed for greater self-sufficiency and the ability to revitalize and preserve culture and the community (Parsons). The Pequot Nation’s culture has faced repeated attempts at decimation that exists to this day as people continue to call them “fake Indians”. Genocide and centuries of forced assimilation have had a negative effect on the community, but the casino allows the Nation to be able to be independent and help revitalize their community and culture (Anthes).
</p>
<p> One of the most noticeable examples is the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center. It is an epicenter of the Tribal Nation’s history and culture that not only enriches the tribal community, but enlightens outsiders of the Mashantucket Pequot Nation’s identity and continuous existence, thus helping correct misunderstandings about the community and educate the public (Lawlor 157).
