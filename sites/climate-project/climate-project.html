<p>      In February of 2020 the United States government destroyed a sacred site with explosions to the Tohono O'odham people to make way for a border wall. This marked an escalation of aggression against the first people of the Americas by the colonial government. This is certainly not the first instance of neglect, and it likely will not be the last. The United States has violated treaties and its own codified laws to get this done. The wall is being built through the middle of the lands that the Tohono O’odham call home. Further dividing the people from ancestral lands, and making already difficult travel near impossible. This insults and neglects indigenous perspectives on water, land, and life as a whole.

	     <p><strong>February 2, 1848 —</strong> The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Guadalupe-Hidalgo" target="_blank">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> was ratified, placing most of the Tohono O’odham Nation’s land in Mexico (<a href="http://www.worldstir.com/history-u-s-mexico-border-wall/" target="_blank">Cromer</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>June 8, 1854 —</strong> The United States paid Mexico $10 million in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Gadsden-Purchase" target="_blank">Gadsden Purchase</a> for nearly 30 square miles of land, drawing a new border between the U.S. and Mexico that split the Tohono O’odham and their land (<a href="http://www.worldstir.com/history-u-s-mexico-border-wall/" target="_blank">Cromer</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>1993 —</strong> President Bill Clinton orders the construction of a border wall 13 miles long between the U.S. and Mexico, stretching from San Diego to Tijuana (<a href="http://www.worldstir.com/history-u-s-mexico-border-wall/" target="_blank">Cromer</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>September 24, 1996 —</strong> The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/104th-congress/house-report/828/1" target="_blank">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</a> is signed into effect by President Bill Clinton, increasing illegal entry fines in addition to approving funding for increased border patrols and wall construction (<a href="http://www.worldstir.com/history-u-s-mexico-border-wall/" target="_blank">Cromer</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>2000 —</strong> Increased border security requires the Tohono O’odham peoples to show papers as they cross the border between their traditional lands in the United States and Mexico (<a href="http://www.worldstir.com/history-u-s-mexico-border-wall/" target="_blank">Cromer</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>May 11, 2005 —</strong> The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/418" target="_blank">Real ID Act</a> is passed, allowing for the secretary of homeland security to waive all federal, state, and local laws to construct a border barrier, including environmental, cultural, public health, or safety laws, exempting the construction of the border wall from legal compliance and participation in public processes (<a href="https://defenders.org/sites/default/files/publications/down_to_the_line.pdf" target="_blank">“Protecting America’s Borderlands”</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>October 26, 2006 —</strong> President George W.

          <strong>August 22, 2019 —</strong> Construction begins on a 2-mile section of the wall at the official entry point in Lukeville, Arizona. This was the first section of the wall to be built using funds diverted to the project under the declaration of emergency (<a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/building-the-wall-a-construction-timeline/551050/" target="_blank">Construction Dive Editors</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>November 9, 2019 —</strong> O’odham activists gather at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument Visitor’s Center to protest the destruction of their ancestral land and its resources for the construction of the wall (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/" target="_blank">Devereaux</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>January 8, 2020 —</strong> Arizona lawmakers introduce a bill that would exempt border wall construction on private property from a building permit and amend state regulations (<a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/building-the-wall-a-construction-timeline/551050/" target="_blank">Construction Dive Editors</a>).<br /><br /> <strong>February, 2020 —</strong> In southwest Arizona, construction crews began blasting hills in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to clear rock for the construction of the wall. The blasts occurred at the base of Monument Hill, a site considered sacred to the Tohono O’odham because it is the final resting place for its former inhabitants and was also the site of several battles (<a href="https://culturalpropertynews.org/tohono-oodham-nation-u-s-blasts-a-monument-to-build-a-wall/" target="_blank">Povolny</a>).</p>

<h2>Sovereignty</h2>

	     <h3>Land Access and Legal Violation</h3>

</figure>



  <p>The construction of the wall inhibits the Tohono O’odham from practicing religious traditions and accessing the lands they have traditionally owned, rights affirmed to them in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (<a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf" target="_blank">United States, Congress</a>). Tribal members routinely cross the border to get vital resources like food, water, and medical services, as well as visit family and attend religious ceremonies. The wall means they must now travel much longer distances to official points of entry and present their American Indian Card to cross through. However, according to Christina Leza’s research, a writer for Indian Country Today, border patrol agents have the discretion to deny entry for security reasons, and have subjected tribal members to arbitrary identity tests like “asking people to speak their Indigenous language or […] perform a traditional song or dance. Those who refuse these requests may be denied entry”(<a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/opinion/for-native-americans-united-states-mexico-border-is-an-imaginary-line-e4cMGbooGUuarEjHt8amZg" target="_blank">Leza</a>). These restrictions and degrading requests endanger the Tohono O’odham's freedom and sovereignty. </p>

<h2>Water</h2>

  <h3>Draining, Degredation, and Sacredity</h3>

    <p>The water being used to mix the concrete to produce the wall comes from a source sacred to the indigenous peoples of the area called Quitobaquito (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/" target="_blank">Devereaux</a>). This degrades the water in a macabre fashion and has the potential to threaten its existence as a whole. There are many forms of life, even beyond people who rely on the spring for survival, and the degradation of the water will have major health impacts for these creatures. </p>
    <p>There is a yearly pilgrimage made by O’odham to their sacred site of Quitobaquito. This salt pilgrimage has been made for thousands of years, and if the physical wall does not stop it from happening, the depletion of the water table and consequently the spring itself may. Quitobaquito is the only natural water source for dozens of miles, if drained, there would be no natural way that it would refill in a short period of time.</p>

<h2>Destruction of Life</h2>
  <h3>Ecosystem Disruption</h3>

McIntyre, Saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea) in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, southwestern Arizona, U.S. Encyclopaedia Brittanica, https://www.britannica.com/place/Organ-Pipe-Cactus-National-Monument#/media/1/431906/92854"><center><strong>Image description: </strong>Saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea) in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, southwestern Arizona, U.S.</center></a></figcaption>
  </figure>

	     <p>Organ Pipe National Monument has an extremely unique and fragile ecosystem that relies on the springs of Quitobaquito as its source of life. Because much of the water in Organ Pipe is being drained to mix concrete for the wall, the lack of water disrupts the entire ecosystem. To make matters worse, Richard Saunders, the Executive Director of Public Safety for the Tohono O'odham, makes clear that the environment will suffer as the finished wall will block a significant source of water for the tribe and all others that share their land (<a href="http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/nowall/" target="_blank">"No Wall"</a>). Construction of the wall has endangered many species belonging to this ecosystem by disrupting migratory patterns, as is the case for the prowling jaguar, and destroying habitats, as is the case for the rare Sonoyta mud turtle, or outright massacre of a population, as is the case for the giant saguaro cactus (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/" target="_blank">Devereaux</a>).<br />

         <br />The saguaro cacti are more than sacred to the Tohono O’odham. In fact, they are themselves considered to be a people. The population of saguaro that can be found around the construction site in Organ Pipe were healthy and were expected to have lived for decades had they not been bulldozed down to clear a path for the wall (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/" target="_blank">Devereaux</a>). The Tohono O’odham place great value on all parts of the saguaro and use them to produce fibers, for ceremonies, as a source of food, and in trade. The saguaro is also used in the production of a fruit wine used in a ceremony to welcome  in the summer monsoon (<a href="https://www.nps.gov/sagu/learn/historyculture/upload/Saguaro-Fruit-A-Traditional-Harvest-Brief.pdf" target="_blank">"Saguaro Fruit: A Traditional Harvest"</a>). Vice Chairman Verlon Jose of the Tohono O’odham explains that the land is not theirs to own, or anyone’s for that matter, but it is their job to protect it (<a href="http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/nowall/" target="_blank">"No Wall"</a>). With this in mind, the devastation felt by the Tohono O’odham Nation as a result of the complete disregard for the saguaro is clear.</p>

  <h3>Desecration of Grave Sites</h3>

	     <p>Just as pressing as the disruption of the Organ Pipe ecosystem, if not more, is the destruction of life at burial grounds and gravesites. Not only will the wall complicate Tohono O’odham access to their ancestral burial grounds, but it will also pose a physical threat to the spirituality of these sacred locations as they can be destroyed during construction (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/story/tohono-oodham-nation-arizona-tribe/582487001/" target="_blank">Náñez</a>). In addition to serving as a sort of oasis for Organ Pipe, Quitobaquito is home to many well-documented Hia-C’ed O’odham burial grounds and gravesites (<a href="https://culturalpropertynews.org/tohono-oodham-nation-u-s-blasts-a-monument-to-build-a-wall/" target="_blank">Povolny</a>). Nellie Jo David, an O’odham activist, indicates that these grounds, located feet from the border, must be protected and preserved because many of those remembered there are their ancestors (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/" target="_blank">Devereaux</a>).<br /><br />The construction of the wall threatens numerous sites with ancestral and historical significance to more than one tribe. Monument Hill is considered sacred by the O’odham peoples and is home to the burial ground of Apache warriors killed in conflict with the O’odham. Las Playas contains sacred O’odham ceremonial grounds as documented by oral history in addition to archaeologists. Cabeza Prieta wildlife refuge is another sacred burial ground four miles to the west (<a href="https://culturalpropertynews.org/tohono-oodham-nation-u-s-blasts-a-monument-to-build-a-wall/" target="_blank">Povolny</a>). Despite O’odham protests against continuations of the project, Monument Hill has already been the site of controlled blasting to clear a path for the wall, and other grounds significant to the Tohono O’odham and other tribes impeding the progress of construction will be targeted next.</p>
<hr>

		 <h2>A Collaborative Effort</h2>
		 <p>The land along the border is home to the Tohono O’odham. Their people are directly subject to trafficking, immigration, and violence across the border more so that most Americans, so the federal government should affirm their sovereignty and long history of experience in their ancestral land by bringing the tribe in as equal partners with the goal of protecting their people, on and off the reservation. Vice Chairman Verlon Jose communicates the belief that continued collaboration and cooperation are the solutions to securing borders, not walls. In the spirit of this line of thought, the Tohono O’odham Department of Public Safety reports that the tribe is currently working with the United States Border Patrol on the Integrated Fixed Towers System as an alternative to the wall, which includes fifteen sensor and surveillance towers that detect and help prevent illegal entry (<a href="http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/nowall/" target="_blank">"No Wall"</a>). There has been an attempt to shift to a more collaborative effort on some projects as has been done with the tower project, but by no means is the federal government working towards a collective understanding of the value of the land and the definition of border security.</p>
