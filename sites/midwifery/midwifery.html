      One of these ways of life is the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit that utilize midwifery. These traditional methods refer to a midwifery system in which women give birth at home within the family group

     The Canadian government started to intervene in the mid-1900s on the medical practices of the Inuit and began to force pregnant women to fly south to have their children in Canadian hospitals

     This forced removal of women from their home community during childbirth has had numerous negative effects on Inuit communities. These communities have begun actively resisting the Canadian government by establishing medical facilities of their own and keeping women in the Inuit community during childbirth.

<h3>History of Inuit Midwifery</h3>
<hr>
  <p> The Inuit were a completely autonomous group of people in the arctic regions of present-day Canada. Their communities consisted of small nomadic groups of hunters that relied on caribou, fish, sea mammals, and the occasional gathering of berries
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada. (2006). The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture.">(Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada 2006)</a>.
 Traditional Inuit culture relied on a form of customary law based on social pressure conducted through the community and elders. The laws practiced were based on culturally specific values and beliefs. </p>

  <figure style="float: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px">

  </figure>

    <p> The introduction of Europeans to the arctic regions of Canada changed the Inuit culture dramatically as the fur trade infiltrated the Inuit autonomous economic structure. Inuit people became more reliant on the products Europeans brought to trade with, and they became necessities in the newly transformed Inuit culture
       <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada. (2006). The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture.">(Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada 2006)</a>.
    The intervention of the settler-colonial government of Canada also had a lasting effect on Inuit culture as their families were torn apart through mandatory residential schooling for Inuit children and customary law was replaced with the Royal Canadian Mountain Police
      <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada. (2006). The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture.">(Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada 2006)</a>. </p>

  <p> Increasing intervention by the Canadian government has impacted the Inuit in several ways. One of the major interventions on Inuit culture, made by the Canadian government, involved the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit. Traditional birthing methods varied across Inuit communities but consisted of a midwife system. Inuit childbirth “embodied an ethic of self-sufficiency or a belief in the mother’s active role in achieving a good outcome,”
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015 pg.26)</a>.
  Starting in the 19th century, European missionaries began providing healthcare but the main intervention came from the government
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>.
   In 1904, Dr. Peter Bryce, Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Indian Affairs, claimed that high rates of infection for children at birth were due to Indigneous birthing rituals
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>. </p>

  <p>This led the Canadian government to feel that action needed to be taken to save Inuit babies and mothers. With the increase of biomedicalization in the first half of the 20th century, more interventions such as nurse visitors and Canadian established nursing stations appeared in Inuit communities.

    </figure>
  The nursing stations did not take community input into consideration and believed that the Inuit people were unable to provide care or seek it out marking it as a paternalistic project by the government
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>.
  These groups relied on the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) to determine risk of Inuit births. In the 1950s, it was found that Inuit IMR was the highest of any ethnic group in Canada and surveys conducted in the 1960s blamed the midwifery system for high mortality
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>.</p>


    <p> The Canadian government moved to evacuate pregnant women from the arctic region to southern hospitals to give birth as their nursing stations were ill staffed, and they saw Canadian biomedicine as the only viable way to deal with IMR. By 1980, 98% of Inuit pregnant women were forced to hospitals in southern Canada to give birth
      <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>.
    This practice completely demolished the cultural practices of community birth by midwives and families. It was also expensive and many of the Inuit women were unable to converse effectively with southern healthcare workers

    By sending women south, it obilerated their culture and autonomy and often created additional problems such as social dislocation, poor diet, family stress, child neglect, and rising substance abuse among Inuit communities

<h3> Present Day: Resistance and Reclaiming of Inuit Midwifery </h3>
<hr>
<p> Rather than creating a solution, the Canadian government created more complications for the Inuit community. Interesting enough, “[r]esults of studies throughout the 1970s showed that it was actually safer [for infants] to be born in Inuit communities ….”
  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Baskett, T. F. (1978). Obstetric care in the central Canadian Arctic. British Medical Journal, 2(61), 1001-1004.">(Baskett, 1978, p. 1004) </a>.
Inuit women are subject[ed] to the social determinants of systemic racism, evident in health care that is not culturally appropriate and that fails to provide relevant services in accessible languages, socioeconomic status which compounds the economic costs and stress of evacuation, and gendered norms which subject them to the patriarchal authority of the medical profession and double duties of working and providing domestic and childcare labour
  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="National Aboriginal Health Organization.(2006). Exploring models for quality Maternity Care in First Nations and Inuit Communities: A Preliminary Needs Assessment.">(NAHO, 2006, p. 15)</a>.
Innuit people have worked to reclaim their traditional birthing methods in order to dismantle negative effects and in doing so they worked towards decolonizing Inuit births.</p>

<p> Programs like the Inuulitsivik Maternities in Nunavik, QC and the Rankin Inlet Birthing Centre in Rankin Inlet, NU, have paved the way in recruiting Inuit women and incorporating Inuit knowledge on childbirth. If we take a closer look at one of the community-based programs, Inuulitsivik Maternities, opened their doors in September 1986. Infant mortality rates have fallen from 8.6% to 3.6% as of 2006, and several thousand births have safely occurred at the Maternities since 1986
  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Kileda, S. (2006). Risky business: contested knowledge over safe birthing services for Aboriginal women. Health Sociology Review, 15(4), 387-396.">(Kileda, 2006, p. 392)</a>.
   There are fewer premature and low birth weight deliveries reported, with rates of complications and birth interventions decreasing significantly when “the majority of births began occurring at the Maternities instead of in Southern hospitals”
  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Douglas, V. (2006) “Childbirth among the Canadian Inuit: A review of the clinical and cultural literature.” International Journal of Circumpolar Health 65(2), 117-132. Houd, S., Qinuajuak , J., & Epoo, B. (2004). The outcome of perinatal care in Inukjuak, Nunavik, Canada 1998–2002.

<p> This was due to an extensive amount of work by conducting public surveys, dialogues, and consulting Inuit communities, specifically, involving elders. Elders feared losing important traditional practices because of the inability to pass them down. However, becoming actively involved in helping Maternities in reviewing taboos, traditions, and childbirth practices created a system that is entirely medicalized, yet, Inuit. The Innulisivik Maternities “[operated] as a “midwifery-led collaborative model of care” using midwives, nurses, and physicians as a multi-disciplinary team”

<p> The Midwifery Education Program uses a modular competency based curriculum, consistent with that of southern midwifery education programs but adapted to the realities of northern practice
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="National Aboriginal Health Organization. (2008). Celebrating Birth: Aboriginal Midwifery in Canada. ">(NAHO, 2008, p. 33)</a>.
Classroom education, hands-on apprenticeship training, and a mentor/mentee system between students and the Maternities’ midwives form the backbone of this program

  As mentioned before, students work with elders in different communities to learn about their storytelling and oral methods of teaching, creating a learning environment where they can take these teachings to advocate for those who live in remote areas and face language barriers. This in return creates a safe environment for patients who feel that they can interact with health care services in a healthy way. There is an understanding that learning takes place not only in a clinical or academic setting, but rather is a holistic experience encompassing the home, community, and land

<p> However, there are limitations within every program. Inuit women face institutionalized racism in the Canadian health care system, and particularly in the evacuation based model which removes them from their communities [when complications with the fetus occur while] the birth event which must take place in southern hospitals under the care of southern health care workers

Toronto: Canadian Scholars’ Press.">(Galabuzi, 2004)</a>.  Not every model is well equipped for every case scenario nor do they easily apply to every community's needs. As mentioned before these programs are not fully western medicalized and not fully Inuit. This can create limitations, like  not adequately supporting Inuit midwives or acknowledging their knowledge within these practices. Stress, unfamiliarity, language barrier, and lack of cultural respect engagement with pregnant Inuit women can lead to a traumatic experience for these women. These programs can work to further failure in  adequately addressing the historical trauma and colonial roots of evacuation, in that a majority of women with complications are still evacuated under this model
